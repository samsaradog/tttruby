# Ruby Version of Tic-Tac-Toe

This will use a Min-Max tree with Alpha/Beta pruning to create a command
line version of Tic-Tac-Toe. The goal is to allow the human to move first
at least occasionally, and for the result to always be either a win by
the computer or a draw.

To run the program, enter:

ruby ttt.rb

Unfortunately, since the program uses require_relative, it needs version
1.9.3 rather than the 1.8.* version installed on many computers

Enjoy!
